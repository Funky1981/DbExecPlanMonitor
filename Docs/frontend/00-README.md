# React Dashboard Build Guide – Frontend Track

This folder contains a step-by-step plan for building a professional React dashboard while keeping you in control (AI-assisted, not AI-driven). Read the files in order and use the prompts to guide Copilot/ChatGPT or another assistant as you build in VS Code.

## File Index (Build Order)

1. `01-react-dashboard-plan.md` – End-to-end build sequence with checkpoints and prompts.

## How to Use

1. Open the repo in VS Code and install GitHub Copilot/Copilot Chat.
2. Before each phase, skim the corresponding section in the plan and copy the suggested prompt into your assistant.
3. Accept only the parts you understand; adjust the code yourself, then rerun lint/tests.
4. Keep commits small so you can revert easily and learn from diffs.
