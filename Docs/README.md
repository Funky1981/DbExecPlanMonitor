# Documentation Index

This `Docs` folder now contains two tracks:

- `backend/` – The original specification pack for the C# execution plan monitoring service (start with `backend/00-README.md`).
- `frontend/` – The React dashboard build guide with an AI-assisted, step-by-step plan (start with `frontend/00-README.md`).

Follow the relevant track based on whether you are working on the backend service or the new frontend dashboard.
